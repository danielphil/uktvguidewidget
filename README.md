# uktvguidewidget
A OS X Dashboard widget for checking UK TV listings

This is a project that I worked on around the launch of OS X 10.4. Since then, I've made a few minor changes but it's been left mostly untouched for years. It still seems to be working correctly, so I'm putting this up on Github to make it available for download as some people have found it useful.

One day, I hope to find the source for it and then push that into the repository as well.
